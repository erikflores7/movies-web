# movies-web
My 1st Web Project. Website/page that contains different lists of movies,
currently Upcoming and Latest pulled from 2 movie APIs

Using: HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, JavaScript/JQuery/Ajax, PHP, and SQL

TODO:
 - improve search function (Add option to search by year,
 make process more efficient, add more movies when searched, 
 redirect to home page or movie page instead of staying on Latest/Upcoming)
 - make everything look better(code and actual movie display)
 - add all other data currently being saved
 - add more lists such as By Genre or Top Rated
 - add actual homepage
 - watch trailer/buy tickets ?
 - accounts? maybe
 - personal ratings/watchlist/recommendations
 - then find better way of getting movie list as current list received is OK
