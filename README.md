# movies-web
My 1st Web Project. Website/page that contains different lists of movies,
pulled from 2 movie APIs, and user features such as personal Watchlists

Using: HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, JavaScript/JQuery/Ajax, PHP, and SQL

TODO:
 - Improve search function (make process more efficient,
  add sorting, and 'Not what you were looking for?')
 - Make everything look better(code and actual movie display)
 - Add more movie lists such as "Top Rated"
 - Add Watch Trailer and Buy Tickets function
 - Accounts (Registering account, emails)
 - Add personal ratings and recommendations
- Find better way of getting better movie lists, without API
 - Add page system when result is > 20 movies
 - Improve alerts such as must
 be signed in to view this page
 - Add email(phone?) alerts for movie releases, optional
 - Email verification to register ?
 - Change password feature
