# movies-web
My 1st Web Project. Website/page that contains different lists of movies,
currently Upcoming and Latest pulled from 2 movie APIs

Using: HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, JavaScript/JQuery/Ajax, PHP, and SQL

TODO:
 - improve search function (make process more efficient, add sorting)
 - make everything look better(code and actual movie display)
 - add more lists
 - watch trailer/buy tickets ?
 - accounts? maybe
 - personal ratings/watchlist/recommendations
 - find better way of getting movie list as current list received is OK
 - when return becomes long enough, limit to like 20 movies displayed,
 rest on pages or something
